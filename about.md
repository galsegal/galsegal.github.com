My name is Gal Segal and I and a web developer working at [SimilarGroup].

I have a true passion coding. Creativity, innovation, challenge and the dynamic nature of our company and community keeps me always on the edge and I love it.   

I would like to use this blog as a place for sharing this passion.

You can find me on [Twitter], [G+] or [email].
