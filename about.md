My name is Gal Segal and I and a web developer working at [eToro]. We are developing a social largest investment network called [Openbook]. My team has a great job: we create the infrastructure for all social engagement. We have performance and scale in mind. Our infrastructure is constantly evolving, as our community grows, and we need to come up with new solutions and create new stuff on a daily basis.

I have a true passion coding. Creativity, innovation, challenge and the dynamic nature of our company and community keeps me always on the edge and I love it.   

I would like to use this blog as a place for sharing this passion.

You can find me on [Twitter] or by [email].
