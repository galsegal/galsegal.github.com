Just stumbled upon a great read about DevOps. The best part was reading about next generation stack monitoring. Monitoring your apps and measuring key factors are the bread and butter of DevOps. You don't need to guess - you measure. 
[DevOps Friday] just published some thoughts from DevOps leaders. I especially liked the article about monitoring stack. Great tools are the ones that need simple implementation, has minor performance impact on apps and give good insights.

If DevOps is your kind of drug, [QCon] has great content about DevOps:
